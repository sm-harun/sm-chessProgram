        <h1>About the project:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>All the diverse moves of every piece are programed into this project. So every piece know what legal moves it has. But bots for generating actual good moves are not implemented yet and are gonna be added soon.</li>
            <li>Currently this program works perfectly for two players with great visuals and UI.</li>
            <li>For one player, for now the oponent is just a bot that plays randomly. Of course, that is gonna change for the future. We are planning to add diverse bots including famous bots like stockfish and mittens using their API's.</li>
            <li>Multiplier is also another feature we are gonna add in the future, So people can play from different devices from far away places.</li>
